The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Kingdom of Cambodia has taken note with deep concern of the recent statement made by Acting Prime Minister of ThailandPhumtham Wechayachai, regarding the preparation of Thai domestic legal actions against Cambodian leaders.2. Such legal action of Thailand against Cambodian leaders, not only violates the sovereignty and integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the principles of sovereign equality and mutual respect enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, but also severely damages Cambodia-Thailand relations. Furthermore, it seriously undermines all efforts exerted so far to achieve a lasting ceasefire and to restore peace and normalcy between the two countries.3. The intended legal action would undermine all endeavors to restore trust and confidence that are much needed to effectively implement the ceasefire agreed by Cambodia and Thailand on 28 July 2025, the terms and steps towards de-escalating the situation concurred and signed by both sides at the Extraordinary Meeting of the Cambodia-Thailand General Border Committee (GBC), on 7 August 2025, including the convening of the Regional Border Committees.4. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation reaffirms the unwavering commitment of the Royal Government of Cambodia to work with the Royal Thai Government to achieve peace and restore relations to normalcy in the nearest future."

Lieutenant General Net Rotha, Head of CMAC operations in Banteay Meanchey and Oddar Meanchey (Region 1), said during a media visit that the site has not yet been cleared since the ceasefire on August 28. The area around Ta Moan Sen Chey Pagoda has not been cleared of unexploded ordnance,” he said, adding, “this zone is not open for free public access.” The pagoda, located in Kok Mon commune, Banteay Ampil district, was among the areas targeted by Thai airstrikes and artillery bombardments during the border clashes. According to Lt Gen Rotha, CMAC officials have so far identified ten large MK84 bombs at the site. “Out of the ten bombs discovered, four have already exploded while six remain unexploded. Among these, five are buried underground and one is lying on the surface,” he explained.The bombs dropped in the area include MK81, MK82, MK83, and MK84 types, many of which were manufactured in 1996, officials said. The armed clashes between Thai and Cambodian forces occurred from July 24–28, 2025, in Oddar Meanchey province and spread to other areas along the border. Cambodian officials said Thai forces initiated the attacks, prompting Cambodian troops to respond in defense of national sovereignty"

The summit concluded without concrete agreements, though both leaders described it as useful and timely.Trump later suggested that Ukraine might need to cede territory to achieve peace, a stance that drew criticism from both domestic and international observers .Following the Alaska summit, Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington, D.C., on August 18. During this meeting, Trump announced plans to facilitate direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin, aiming to resolve the ongoing conflict. European leaders expressed cautious optimism, emphasizing the need for robust security guarantees for Ukraine and a commitment to territorial integrity In the aftermath of these diplomatic efforts, Russia launched a significant missile and drone attack on Ukraine, marking the largest such assault in August. The strike targeted energy infrastructure, leading to widespread fires and raising concerns about Russia's commitment to peace negotiations As of now, discussions continue regarding the potential location for the proposed Zelenskyy-Putin summit, with Geneva being suggested as a neutral venue. The international community remains watchful, awaiting concrete steps toward a lasting resolution to the conflict "

        content:"China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) seeks to reinforce transnational trade routes with infrastructure, resource extraction, and economic cooperation across Asia, Europe, and Africa. Since the early 2000s, Chinese Overseas Cooperation Zones have played a major role in solidifying bilateral cooperation and incubating Chinese overseas investment. As a result, there are 182 Chinese-financed zones that have been developed in 52 countries. The Mekong Region is currently an important destination for Chinese investment due to its proximity to China and diasporic connections. However, the geopolitics of the long 20th century has also produced a fractured region with complex bilateral and multilateral interventions, and varied affinities with China. My project is a transnational comparison of two Chinese overseas cooperation zones in Cambodia and Thailand to understand whether Chinese overseas projects have varying outcomes in different host nations, and how power-relations between states inform spatial practices.Recent scholarship of Chinese overseas investments, especially in infrastructural and industrial development, have largely focused on international relations and economic policies rather than their urban and environmental implications. An infrastructural approach grounds the research in the physical and material realities of the landscape while attending to the multiple scales of politics, economics, and social impacts inside and outside of these zones. By starting with the physical landscape in its regional context, I avoid the common tendency of viewing zones as abstract enclaves, but rather an integral component in economic development and urban change. In addition, it recognizes conflicting geopolitical interests of other international actors and the agency of local communities"

After receiving Royal Assent, the Bill will become an Act, and its legislation will be implemented.The Bill was first introduced on 4 June 2024 and was passed late last night by 69 votes to 47.The Bill will dissolve the Scottish Qualifications Authority, the national body previously tasked with overseeing qualifications in Scotland, which will be replaced by Qualifications Scotland. Qualifications Scotland will then be responsible for developing, regulating, and awarding any non-university level qualifications.The Bill will also create the office of Chief Inspector of Education, a role with enhanced independence and whose responsibilities will include ensuring schools and education authorities are making necessary improvements, and publishing annual reports on the performance of the Scottish education system.The decision to reform the education system came in part from recommendations from a report by Professor Ken Muir which called for a ‘renewed vision’ of education in Scotland.Ahead of the Bill being passed, Children in Scotland released a statement saying:As the Scottish Parliament debates Stage 3 of the Education (Scotland) Bill, we remain committed to ensuring the voices of children and young people are not just heard, but meaningfully embedded, in the future of Scottish education.At Stage 1 we highlighted a range of concerns with the proposals in particular around a lack of ambition and a lack of clarity on the mechanisms for the participation of children and young people to engage with and participate in the new qualifications body and inspectora.If the Bill becomes law, we will work closely with Scottish Government and the new education bodes to ensure there are meaningful opportunities for children and young people.We have heard consistently from Changing our World, the Inclusion Ambassadors and many other project groups about the need for change in how their education is delivered.With this in mind, we are still concerned that the Education (Scotland) Bill is not ambitious enough in how it looks to drive change in education in Scotland. If the Bill comes into law, we will continue to advocate for and with children and young people for an education system which supports their rights and needs"

        content:"When football fans think of the AFC West and AFC East, the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills jump out above the rest with their divisional dominance. However, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers may have one of the most underappreciated divisional championship reigns in recent history as the Bucs have won four straight NFC South titles, yet they don't garner the same respect as other consistent winners. Fantasy football players should be aware of Tampa Bay though, with Baker Mayfield coming off a QB4 season with Bucky Irving at RB13 and Mike Evans as WR14 for the No. 4 scoring team in the NFL.Where should these Tampa Bay options fall in 2025 Fantasy football rankings? With Chris Godwin still recovering from a season-ending ankle injury, could Tampa Bay produce 2025 Fantasy football sleepers at receiver with young pass-catchers like Jalen McMillan or Emeka Egbuka? Before crafting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine.Last year, the model accurately predicted that Bills running back James Cook would comfortably outperform his ADP (RB14). The result: Cook rushed for 1,009 yards and 16 touchdowns while adding 32 receptions for 258 yards and two more scores as a receiver. He finished as RB8 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and his maturation into a scoring threat cemented his status as a Fantasy football superstar.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title."
